# Active Transport of Cargo-Carrying and Interconnected Chiral Particles

This repository contains the C++ codes for the project - Chirality modulated accumulation of active particles, the first problem solved during my PhD at Universit√§t Augsburg. The project deals with the accumulation behavior of a composite of a chiral active particle connected to a passive particle by a harmonic spring in an activity gradient. The activity gradient is implemented by making the active particle experience a space-dependent swim force. This work has culminated into an article which can be found on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18703

The file ccp_density.cpp calculates the steady state density of a composite in a sinusoidal activity field, showing that the accumulation behavior can be controlled using the chiral torque as a control paramameter.
