# Cargo-carrying-chiral-active-particles
This repository contains the C++ codes for the project - Chirality modulated accumulation of chiral active particles, the first problem solved during my PhD at Universit√§t Augsburg. The project deals with the accumulation behavior of a composite of a chiral active particle connected to a passive particle by a harmonic spring in an activity gradient. The activity gradient is implemented by making the active particle experience a space-dependent swim force. This work has culminatedd into an article which can be found on arXiv (insert arxiv link) or on the web (insert article link when published.)
The file ccp_density.cpp calculates the steady state density of a composite in a sinusoidal activity field.
